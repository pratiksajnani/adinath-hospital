## 📝 RECORDING TIPS

1. **Speak slowly** - Viewers need time to see what you're clicking
2. **Pause on each page** - Let the page fully load before speaking
3. **Use mouse highlights** - Circle important elements with your cursor
4. **Keep it under 7 minutes** - Attention spans are short
5. **Record in a quiet room** - Background noise is distracting

## 🎯 AFTER RECORDING

1. Copy your Loom link (e.g., `https://www.loom.com/share/abc123xyz`)
2. Share with me and I'll add it to:
   - README.md
   - SITEADMIN_DEMO.html
   - Homepage (optional)
